# Frontier Strain 


## Overview

Frontier Strain is a local & multiplayer arena action game, set in the Wild West, (also known as the  American Frontier), where a new Cholera strain has the world on its knees. Four players fight to the death, using guns, swords and even their fists, with unique, different characters. 


##Story (Brief)

In the disease-ridden deserts of the American Frontier, survivors fight to the death to reach the cure - the only thing between them and death. Who will you pick? 


##Story (Detailed)

The game is set in 1873, in the the Western United States. A new cholera strain has devastated  the American Frontier. With the population a fraction of what it was before, and things looking very grim, a rumor starts that a doctor discovered a cure before perishing himself. With this new revelation, everyone goes after the cure, with each character having different motivations and stories to tell. All characters have one thing in common - all of them want the cure, no matter the cost.

The story will be on the background and be told to the players indirectly, with small mentions here and there. Each character tell their stories during matches, with bigger mentions happening if they win. This will be an additional incentive to win the match for players who are curious about the lore.


##Gameplay (Brief)

You play as one of the heroes who are after the cure. The game can be played locally with four players, or online with one. Characters will battle each other in different arenas and try to survive three rounds while making sure the other players don’t.


##Gameplay (Detailed)

Frontier Strain 2D game that can be played locally with four people or online with one player. The game is played on multiple levels (“arenas”) with different layouts, each centered around the Wild West theme. Each game has three rounds, with an extra sudden-death round if there is a tie.

The game is won by eliminating the rest of the players while surviving yourself. All characters can run, jump, shoot and use melee. Each character has different characteristics, e.g. The Cowboy may start with more bullets, while The Dancer can move faster and jump higher and so on. Each player can choose one character.

Each character starts with three bullets and melee weapon. Bullet do more damage, but they are more valuable and harder to hit. Throughout the round, bullet and health pickups respawn in set places, to discourage people from hiding or camping. To further encourage fast paced gameplay, after a minute players will start to lose health which will cause them to hurry. This will be caused by an environmental effect (e.g lava rising, earthquake, meteor shower), which will be unique to every level.

The levels are big, with a good number of platforms and places to hide and ambush. All the levels will have their own theme (e.g desert, cave, ship and so one), their own tile set and their own soundtrack. The plan is to have each level be tied to a character, for example the ship level will be The Pirate’s map, while the saloon level will be tied to The Dancer.

Online play will feature character progression and matchmaking according to skill levels.
