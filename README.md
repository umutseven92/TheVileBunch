##Gameplay 

The Vile Bunch 2D game that can be played locally with four people or online with one player. The game is played on multiple levels (“arenas”) with different layouts, each centered around the Wild West theme. The game ends when a player reaches three wins.

The game is won by eliminating the rest of the players while surviving yourself. All characters can run, jump, shoot and use melee. Each character is the same gameplay wise, with cosmetic changes. Each player can choose one character.

Each character starts with three bullets and melee weapon. Bullet do more damage, but they are more valuable and harder to hit. Throughout the round, different pickups respawn in set places, to discourage people from hiding or camping. To further encourage fast paced gameplay, after a minute players will start to lose health which will cause them to hurry. This will be caused by an environmental effect (e.g lava rising, earthquake, meteor shower), which will be unique to every level.

The levels are big, with a good number of platforms and places to hide and ambush. All the levels will have their own theme (e.g desert, cave and so on), their own tile set and their own soundtrack. The plan is to have each level be tied to a character, for example the cave level will be The Prospector’s map, while the saloon level will be tied to The Dancer.

Online play will feature character progression and matchmaking according to skill levels.
